write me a blurb for "why should we hire this candidate" at Google. 

make note of the following:
- lyft ML SWE - experience with building models from scratch and productionizing them so that they are used by millions of users every day
- Amazon Alexa Applied Scientist where I co-authored a paper " Leveraging ASR N-best in deep entity retrieval " and shipped a production model used in alexa devices today, for the smarthome domain
- general proficiency with NLP, AI and healthcare, as evidenced by my graduate research at UofT, where I first-authoured "Exploring Text Specific and Blackbox Fairness Algorithms in Multimodal Clinical NLP" which received best short paper at ClinicalNLP workshop at EMNLP 2020

Feel free to rewrite each of these points to make them sound better
